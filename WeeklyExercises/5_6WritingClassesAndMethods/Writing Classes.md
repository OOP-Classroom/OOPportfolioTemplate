# ﻿5 and 6 Writing Classes and Methods
***Ensure you commit the exercises to GitHub and give the repo and java files sensible names.***


## Example Programs


***1) Sphere***
 
Design and implement a class called Sphere that contains instance data that represent a sphere’s diameter.
-   Define a Sphere constructor to accept and initialize the diameter.
-   Include getter and setter methods for the diameter.
-   Include methods to calculate and return the volume and surface area of the sphere.
-   Include a toString method that returns a one-line description of the sphere.
-   Create a driver class (main class) called MultiSphere, whose main method instantiates and updates several Sphere objects.
 
***2) Books*** 
 
Design and implement a class called Book that contains instance data for title, author, publisher and copyright date.
-   Define that Book constructor to accept and initialize these data.
-   Include setter and getter methods for all instance data.
-   Include a toString method that returns a nicely formatted, multiline description of the book.
-   Create a driver class called Bookshelf, whose main method instantiates and updates several Book objects.
 
***3) Bulb***
 
Design and implement a class called Bulb that represents a light bulb that can be turned on and off.
-   Create a driver class called Lights, whose main method instantiates and turns on some Bulb objects
 
***4) Account***
 
Modify the Account class from the unit examples so that it also permits an account to be opened with just a name and an account number, assuming an initial balance of zero. Modify the main method of the Transactions class to demonstrate this new capability.
 
***5) Cards***
 
Design and implement a class called Card that represents a standard playing card. Each card has a suit and a face value. Create a program that deals five random cards.
